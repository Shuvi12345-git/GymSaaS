"""
Simulated notifications for Jupiter Arena (utils).

In production you would replace this with real WhatsApp Business API, email (SendGrid, etc.),
or SMS. For now, all notifications are printed to the backend console so you can verify
the flow when testing registration, payment received, fee reminders, or status change.

Usage: from utils import send_notification
  send_notification("registration", {"name": "John", "phone": "9999999999", "email": "j@x.com"})
  send_notification("payment_received", user, {"amount": 500})
